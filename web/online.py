"""In-process online-visitor counter for the site footer, plus day/week
unique-visitor tallies.

The "online now" count tracks unique client IPs that have hit
``GET /api/online`` within ``ONLINE_WINDOW`` seconds. State lives in a
module-level dict shared by all requests on the single uvicorn process; a
restart simply resets the count, which is fine for a "who's here right now"
indicator. No persistence, no external store.

The day/week counts need to survive a restart, so they're backed by the
``site_visits`` DB table (one row per unique visitor per day, IP stored only
as a truncated hash). Writes are deduped in-memory per day so a visitor's
repeat 30 s heartbeats don't hit the database, and both are best-effort: if
the DB is unavailable the site keeps serving and these just report 0 (see
CLAUDE.md's "site keeps serving the public dashboard" contract).
